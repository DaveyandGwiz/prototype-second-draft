little distracted at the moement. Some lady sat directly in my filed of view. I like to think that 
she's trying to get my attention because I have a bit of an ego right now.
I feel beeter about my--
This built in fiucking auto correct is the devil, it is so ditracting. How can I shut it off?!?!?!
Ok, the UI is a little annoying but it looks like I turned the damn thing off.

some people seemed to walk by and laugh at me. It does make me feel self conscious I wonder if there isanything peculuar in the way I go about writing?
I doubt this would happen if I was in a coffeee shop, though it might.

wow, some super henched guy just walked by. I wonder if he's a body buolder? Dude has huge lats.
I'm feeling lgiht-headed right now. I wonder if it's the extra 100 caolories I'm burning in the morning?

I dont know if my hunger has increased or I'm just tired of being hungry at this point. I want to get a lttle more thin before I start my reverse diet.
AT this point, I esstially have started my revesere diet. I've been eating about 2k calories and still feeling drained as hell.
Not sure and extra 100-200 would make that much of a difference in subjective hunger.

probably just eating more feeling foods would help and less unfilling ones, e.g. nuts, protein powerds, banananas, occasional candies.

Ugh, now I want to leave.
I want to hit my vape and people keep coming in.
So hungry today...
yeah I slept i this morning and feel reall  tired.
Evev now I feel so drained.

I'm thinking I'll finish my drink and head home for a nap.
I have a couple items on my to-do list, but nothing major. I'm not visiting the park today.
I put that off.

Mostloy today I just need to work on my draft.

Coming back to it this evening. I'm glad I got started on my windows service. I'll feel proud when I have ot done.
I feel frustrated though. I was really hoping to complete it, ChatGPT really jsut got in the way. FileSysWat doesnt seem to satisfy the use case.
I didnt leanr much. Mostly copied pasted code then got frustrated when it dodnt work so stipid.
If coding was so simple would the accomplisjmet really be worth anythong?
I jsut didnt want to go through the effort but what value would the effort have ifit didnt require leanring?

Anyway, I'm going to try to calm down so I can do a little writing before bed. 
Ha, best.
