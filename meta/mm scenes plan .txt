according tomy doc I have 112 prodvided this scenes are mostly quite small


23 days feb
16 days march

so 33 days total

I have 112 scenes to write and edit

So if I write and edit 5 to 6 scenes a day it'll be doable.
But I'll have to work often and hard.

Let's say I work in two sessions a day.
then I have

( 112 scenes + 112 edits ) / 78 sessions

Then I have to write 2.8 scenes every session.

how about one scene a session and spill over goes on weekends.

39 days is about 6 weeks. 6 weeks is 12 weekend days and 30 weekdays

so,  112*2 = 30 days * 1 WD session + X days * 12 WE session

I need to write 6-7 scenes on weekends. I'll put on my calendar.
---
I gave myself now to march 16, so I have 11 + 16 = 27 days left.
That's multiple scenes a day. What if I strecth it out a month?
Let's say I did one scene each weekday and two on saturaday and 3 on Sunday. That's 5+2+3 = 10 scenes a week.
So I need 11 weeks.
how many weeks do i have left, 4.
So, I need 7 more weeks.
So, now I'm finishing my novel April 20th.


How much time does that leave me for everything else?

So here's how my schedule has changed. 
I just removed the MM short story and lessened the VN focus by a week. 12 scenes a week. This is double without working so hard.
Now back to it.
