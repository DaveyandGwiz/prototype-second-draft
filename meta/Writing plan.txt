Orignially I thpught it take me three to 3-4 months to write the prototype but then I scheduled myself to write in two months.
I didnt realze how much life would get in the way.

What were my notes?
Here's the plan I wrote:

January:
Re read the prototype
Create a storyboard
February:
Start second draft
Roughly revise a chapter every three chapters.
March:
Finish second draft.
Take a one to two week long break.
April:
Write DMC vs MegaMan Short story
May:
Take week off.
Start writing visual novel adaptation
June:
Do research for Wendy and Casper
Start Wendy and Casper
July:
Finish Wendy and Casper
Take one to two weeks off
August:
Start and finish the space knight

September:
Finish the space knight
Take one to two weeks off

October:
Options: focus on visual novel, start beacon University, or rewrite the sequel to the prototype

November December TBA 
It be cool to start on horsemen this year.
