I want to learn more about gutar and how kids play music but 
what do I already know?

Rocky dreams of being a famous musician.
He hopes music will bring him closer to dr. light and to other people.
He works very hard.

Other people dismiss his hard earned progress just because he is a robot.

It hurts him and he wants to prove them wrong.
Music is what rocky loves.

he wants to connect to others and show himself to the world through music.

he has fear that he wont succeed.
