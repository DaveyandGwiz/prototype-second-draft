so right now, I want to get to know more about Rocky's and Roll's situation at school before the story starts.
I talked about it a bit in the first draft, but I'd like to go about it in a more concise way. I want to explore it a bit.

one scene I wanted in the first draft never ended up happening the scene where Rocky the first spends time around
kids his age and gets bullied.

I've thought that I'd like the first rocky to go to school the same school as the second rocky.
By the time the second rocky replaces him, he finds himself surrounded by kids who dont like him and judge him for 1) being a robot,
and 2) past expereices they had with him.

This is a strange experience for Rocky the second. even though he is more socially attuned than rocky and deals with less trauma and emotional
problems he none-the less finds himself in a situation with a status quo.

This is why Rocky really ends up shutting oithers out as a default.
I'm still not sure what I want the time period to be for all this.

1- Rocky the first is in school
2- Rocky the second replaces proto-rocky in school
3- Roll comes online

I dont want these time periods to be long. As short as possible, honestly.
And just enough time so I can slip MM 4 in somewhare.
Probaly like a year at most.

When we enter the world of MegaMan we find the truth of Wil's introduction.
Of course there is fear and uncertanty surronding robots and AI but much like the current situation with LLMs, people remain
largley passive and continue to utilize the technologies despite the fears and uncertainties. 
The more I think about it the more it make me suspocious of people the facte that some many people (myself included) have fear and uncertanty
around AI but contiue to ustilize the technology regardless.
Once the wave is in place what is one to do anyway?


I recognize Rocky is feeling a lot of the same things I'm feeling right now.
Perhaps I need to look deeper into my emotions. I'm not as anti-social as I act in this neighborhood I almost forget that.
Look how I am at stores or at the shelter.
The issue is how I relate to peers, how I relate to people in a context where I dont feel safe, where people already have a negative opinion of me.
I wonder if Rocky feels the same way?
Maybe he has friends through Quatre who dont know that he is even a robot. 
How does rocky feel about being a robot?
He feels pride but something else... not shame... but a fear fear that people judge him for it.
Maybe even deeo down a fear that there is something wron with him.
That he is less good, less worthy.

How would my life have been as a boy if I was a robot?

Rocky, would you let me look deeper into your life, your wourld? I'd reaaly like to get to know you better.
And know everything that happened.
--
what was it like for Rocky when he first came online?
He didnt remeber everything that happened before being reset he didnt remember the operating table or everything that happened in Protomans flashback scene I know that.
Deep within rockys unconscios he has all of protomans memories but I'm not sure he explicitly remembers anything till the end. I think that 
rocky still is influenced by these memories at an uncosncious level.

he came online raised by ava living with her. He found himself in a school situation surrounded by children that didnt like him that thought he was weak
many that bullied him in the past.
I wonder what that must have been like for rocky walking into someone elses shoes someome was disliked and not thought well of?
He used to be older than the other kids his age.
Perhaps rocky the first went to kindergarten?
Elementary school: Kindergarten through 5th grade, ages 5â€“10
if protoman was with six year olds, rocky is with 7 year olds, rocky is modled to be 8 years old and feels comfortable in his body at the start of act 1
When did roll come online?
SHe came online less than a year ago I think. That would in part explain her very infantile behavior and why now she is being shown to the world.
