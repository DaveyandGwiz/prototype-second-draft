SCENE: ROCKY HAS A DREAM AND ROLL WAKES HIM UP
* nightmare
* roll wakes him up about her dream
* info dump
* we learn how roll has rocky's memories.
* then the next scene is rocky remembering the previous day.
Instead I want rocky to prepare for guitar class recital.
This will be a new scene but one I want to try out.
Glad I have a short scene to write. Perhaps it needs more substance? I'm writing one scene but
it's part of a larger chapter.
I just realized rocky has dreams he later says he doesnt. I'll come back to this.

-- Chapter One: Rocky's Dreams

Rocky! Rocky!
a strange voice shoted me name as I stood in pitch black darkenss.
Wjere am I?
The lighst shot on and and I moved my arm infront of my face to block out the light. I looked around
I was standing up on a stage. before me a corwd of people sta pointing and laughing
Rocky!

//Lights shot on and I looked around me. I was up on a stage the bottles and rocks crowd heurl across the floor 
//as the people contiued to laugh and point in their seats.
// They were laughing at me.
I took some steps downstage.
spreading my arms I opened my mouth, the crowd grew silent.
...
I couldnt remeber.
The words didnt come to me. What was I supoosed to say?

the silence died and the crowd continued laughing this time hurling object toward me.
I covered my face with my arms then noticed the bright red glow behind me. I turned towards it. 
//Then a was a bright red glow shot behind me and I turned towards it.

There was a giagantic robotic hand, glowing red hot like lava. 
No... stay away... I said stepping backwards.
the robotic hand crept closer.
Rocky!
hand moved towars getting closer and closer untill...

Rocky!

OOFFF

I woke up in my bed to find my sister Roll jumping on top of me.

Rocky! I had one again! I had one!

Our dog joined roll and jumped on top of my bed circling around and stepping on my legs several
times before jumping back off.

Rocky I had another dream... Do you want to hear what it was?!

I looked at the clock on my internal interface.
Roll, it's 4:15 AM! I have to practice in the morning...

Roll's green eyes lit up with excitement, ignoring what I said completely she curled her legs up and beamed at me intently. Rocky, ok rocky here's how my dream went I was stadning on a building, no that's not how it started. How did it go again?

Sigh... My little sister, Roll. Well, I call her my little sister. She was actually in development before me, but only came online a year ago. Decding who the older sibling is can get pretty complicated when you're both robots!

Roll's design is a little different from mine. When I first came online even though I looke dthe same I was  like a baby in terms of what I knew. I had to learn how to talk and read and write. For roll however Dr. Light decded he use my data to program roll before she first came online.

Oh, I remember it now! Roll said, clapping her hand together happily.
brushing her long blonde hair out her face roll looked at me intently as she began her story.
I was sitting on the egde of a building playing a guitar, then a big red monster jumped on top of me. And the, when I stood up, a giant came! And took mmy guitar away! Do you remember anything like that?"

Roll was only supposed to know about pratical things from my data however... as tiem has gone on Ive learned that roll has access to some of my personal memories. it started when roll would tell me about these dreams she has. I coulnt help but notice how similar they were to things that have happened to me. At this point Roll remebers half of my life during last year, even all the most embarrasing stuff. It's really annoying honestly.

I put my fist to my chin and thoguht about it for a moment. Oh, I know. That was from my second year. Around the time Rush first came online. Ava brought him to school when picking me up and he was so exicted when he saw me that he jumped up on me and knocked my guitar out of my hands. Oscar from grade six came and helped me replace the broken strings.

Really?! Roll asked excitedly. Do you still have the gutiar can I play it? She said, looking around frantically.

// maybe I could move above exposition here and remove this. We can infer how annoyng Rocky finds Roll.
Even though Roll is supposed to be my “age” she really acts just like a kindergartener. She cries when she doesn't get her way, she will blurt out the most embarrassing things at the most awkward times. It’s so annoying. I've told Dr. Light about it, but insists it isn't a problem. He doesn't have to put up with Roll as much as I do.

“No, Roll! I said. I have to go back to sleep. Now, go back to bed or I won't help you understand your dreams anymore!”

And after hearing this, Roll sprinted out of the room.

Running away, Roll left the door open and my room was filled with light from the hallway.

…She could have at least shut the door behind her.


--- NEXT SCENE: ROCKY GETS READY FOR SCHOOL
originally I have the scene were rocky and roll go to the zoo. I'm cutting this for now. I want rocky to start preparing for the recital. This is a good chance for us to learn about rocky who he is what he wants how he relates to those around him.

rocky is preparign for the play hamlet as a  guitarist
rocky gets dressed and talks briefly about his appearance and body.
I dont mind being a robot

"I think the only thing I don't like about it is being different…I like being a robot. I just don't like feeling different from other kids. Or the things people say sometimes. 

I’m really not so different from everybody else. I was just made in a different way.
"
Here we see Rocky pushing against the thesis of the book: is a person born into a bad situation better of dead?
Rocky is treating the syptoms and not the cause.
That becuase he is a robot he is different and because he is different others will judge him.
-rework
rocky wants to be accepted and admired.
part of him hates being seen as different cause hes a robot
rocky has gieven up on makking friends at his currrent school due to bullies
he wants to prove everyone wrong

- what do I want to happen in my rework scene?
rocky thinks about the recital. its  a big deal for him.
he has dreams of being a famous muscian.
Light loves music and rocky want to make light proud.
Rocky wnats to play music for many reasons.
He knows people love music, he beeives that if his music is good enough people will forget hes a robot.
he wants to prove robots can become artists
he wants to impress light who named rocky after his love of music
he wants light to call him son and be told his is loved.
in thruth rocky is quite lonely.
Whats keeping him going is the hope tha light loves him, light is good, and one day light will accpet rocky as a son.
That rocky believes that even though he is a robot he really isnt different from other people.
// he will come to learn this is wrong. he is different and the world will mistreat his kind because of their differences.
thrhough rockys relationship to other robots rocky will see that he isnt really like other people 
but that robots have feelings too. That people are mistreating them.


SCENE: Rocky Leaves for School

Brief interaction between Ava, Roll, Rush, and Rocky before he lieaves for school.
I'm rewriting this scene. Not sure how I'll do it yet.
I think what i'll do is have a brief interaction with Quatre eating breakfast before I jump straight to the recital.
The scene with Quatre will be a good intro for us to learn more about Rocky.
Some of his shame about being a robot.
What his relationship with his one friend looks like

Only prbolam is-didnt we already learn a lot of this info as Rocky stayed awake to practice?
What else do we learn then?
I think we'll write the scene then see what happens.
There's a lot in the original script I like, my issue is that it doesnt jump straight to the action or provide
anything about Rocky that tells us about the problem he's facing and motivates us to want to see how this issue will pan out.
I want for this second draft to be more concise and to introduce us to the intresting issue Rocky is dealing with.
We want to know what Rocky's struggle and desire is and how he intends to deal or not deal with it.

In a nut shell: the robotic boy feels judged, excluded, unloved by his creators. he plans to impress them through his talent as an arttist.
Will he be able to do it? How will he respond to failure?

-- Further thoughts
After the rectial, rocky wonders if other humans will ever appreciate him.
He tells us as long as he has Light's approval he is content. We also learn about rocky's shame as a robot.
this will be an issue when rocky grows to care more for robot masters and sees light and other humans more negatively and diff from him.
I may or may not use the math class scene. I want to jump to the action.

THEMES IN ACT ONE: rockys struggle for acceptence, shame as a robot, desire to please light, 
virus and fear of robots, Rocky's growing compassion for robots and distrust of humans, The villian the prototype (created by humans), 
arrives, the theat to humans and robots, rocky sees the chance to help Light robots and people as MegaMan,
Rocky is forced to destroy robots,
Rocky sees the evil people do,
Rocky hears of the real cause of the virus: robots want to die,
Rocky decides he will protect the one person he loves,
he loses that person
END ACT ONE   

These are the major beats up and coming:

SCENE: ROCKY GETS LEAVES FOR SCHOOL
SCENE: MATH CLASS
SCENE: LUNCH, BULLIES, AND ROCKY LEARNS ABOUT REI
SCENE: BAND LAST REHEARSAL
SCENE: ROCKY TAKES RUSH FOR A “WALK”
SCENE: ROLL’S FIRST NIGHTMARE
SCENE: ROCKY GOES TO SEE REI
SCENE: ROLL’S DEBUT

- SCENE: Rocky Leaves for School

By the time I walk over to close the door I realize I'm as good as awake.
Just as well. At least now I have more time to reherse. I walk over to the side of my room decorated in music paraphelia.
Posters, vinlys, and piles of CDs decorate the wall. Elvis, the beatles, Van Halen, and even some posters of classical composers like 
Mozart and Bach all the artists I look up to!
People always think it's stange for a robot like me to listen to so interested in all these old music. Epsceially when 
so many people today listen to digital music, give me the sound of a real instrument any day!
I pull old trusty and which was on his standy out his case. sitting on the edge of my bed I admire my wood brown gutar and feel its weight against
my body.
I pull out my tuning fork and after striking it against my knee begin tuning the strings.
My eyes wainder towards my wall of posters as I listen intently listen to each notes.
Elvis presely, The Beatles, Van Halen, Green Day, and Paramore. I even have posters of classical composers like Beetoven and Bach!
People always think it's starange for a robot like me to be so intrested in old music. Espcially when the music most people listen to now
is all didgital. Give me a real instrument anyday! You can hear the passion in each notes. People just dont get it.
Rock-y. Rock-and-roll? Dr. Light named us after his love for music. He even toled me that when he was a boy  
he wanted to be in a rocky band, but that he wasnt any good at guitar.

I pull out my sheet music before I laughing it and placing it down. You dont need sheets when you get the heart of the song.
With precision I begin strumming each note and each chord of our recital piece, pressing my fingeers to the frets just tight enough to hear 
full clear ring.
1, 2, 3, 1,2,3
I can hear the crowd already.
Rocky! Rocky!
I toss my hands up and walk up to the mic.
Thank you thank you.
I try to give a speech but the crowd contiues shouting my name.
Rocky rocky!
And they said rock and roll was dead I laugh to myself.
I can already see the headline: Robot brings back real music.
The news reports face reveal awe as they talk about my newest albums success.
Rocky's solo album has already gone triple platnum within it's first week.
They said guitars and drums were a thing of the past. They said that the one thing a robot could never do was create art.
That was before the world got to see dr. lights light greatest creation for what he really is!
That was before they knew about me!
The crowd continues chanting and I raise me first in the air in triumph. The crowd goes wild.
I turn my head when I hear a subltle clap and see a man walking towrds me on the stage.
Dr. Light?!
Well, done rocky well done. Dr. Light smiles contently. I expected nothing less of my greatest creation.
I smile and shoot my eyes down in emabressment. I let out a weak, I-I just hope you like it, Doctor. I said.

I look up when I feel Dr. Light firmly grasp my sholder.
Of course I'm proud of you, son....

knock knock. My beaustiful vision is inturupted when I hear a loud, persistant, annoying rap at my door.

What are you doing in there Rocky?! Were going to be late for school!

//After playing the piece from start to sinsih three times I finally decide to take a break and shake out my hands.
//Guess its about time I start ed getting ready.
//Walking to the closet and pull out my short, shirt, and tie. A our schools uniform.
//Most kids hate that we have to wear times, but not me. For me it makes me feel
I check the time. It was already past 6am.

The door creaks open and a tall dark haired woman with bright red lips and thinkly layered glass enters the room.
Is everything alright Rocky? SHe asks in her typical bright and cheery tone.
Ava Lovelace. An assitant of doctors light's specifically tasked with the job of over seeing the development of me and roll. Basically our nanny. She's the olny person who lives
in this house besides me, Roll and our dog rush.

I see you got caught up in practing again, Ava laughs, placing her hand to her chin.


Oh, sorry I say! Quickly running over to pull my uniform out of the dresser before running inside of my bathroom to put it on.

Now I'm going to be late because of you! Roll shouts loud enough to be heard through the door.
Just we wont even have time for breakfast now! ANd I'm hungry!

Pulling up my time, lean my head through door. I get roll I get jeez you dont have to make.
I was finsihed speaking rocky! Roll  sighs. You know, you really should listen when you older sister is talking to you!

Older sister? Since when? I'm your big brother! I state.

Heh.. Roll gives a cocky grin. Like I'd believe that. I was in developemnt befor eyou ROCKY! And guess what that makes me? 
You older sister! 
What! I gasp wh-who told you.
Ava did.
Ava! I shoot a glance in Ava's direction.

Oh, I'm sorry rocky. She exclaims. Was I not supposed to tell Roll?

Yes! I exclain. Cause now I'll never hear the end of it. I point in rolls direction, Listen, Roll... You may have been in development before me, but the
only reason you know anything is because you have my memory data--are you listening?!

Who's a good boy? Who's a goood boyyyy...
Ignoring me completely, Roll bends over on the ground to scratch Rush's white metal tummy as he violently wags his tail.

Anyway, let's get goingm Roll stands up. I havent even packed my breakfast yet. now I'm going to be Hungry all day. 
I already packed lunch for you Ava says handing her a light blue chunli thememed lucnh box. And I packed one for you as well, Rocky.
Roll wucilky picks open her box. lets see... Pb&J, Sweet roll, carrots, juice. Uggh... carrots! Could I get another sweet roll instead?”
Now, Roll, Ava raises her finger. You need to eat your vegetables. Just because you and rocky are robots doesnt mean you shouldnt eat healty! 

Ha, youre right, Roll stcicks out her tongue and places her hand behind her head. I'll be sure to eat those too. You'll be a good mommy one day, Ava.

Now Roll! Ava places her hand over her mouth as she gasps. Look roll, I'm just dr light's lab assistant I could hardly be considered you and rocky's mother.
I mean  unless me and dr. light started dating and he wanted to... She palces her hands over her eyes as her face turns beat red. No no that's totalyy inappropriate. 
Listen, you and rocky should just think of me as one of Dr. Light's feelow scietists, or a nanny, our maybe even a a dear aunt... 
Though I wonder what Dr. Light would think if he heard you call me that... do you think he'd...

Okay roll I'm ready. I climb on top of ruhes back as he turns his legs into levitaing mode. Come on! We'll get to school faster on rush!

Roll steps onboard as she grabs onto my shoulders.

Even if we get there on time, I'm still going to be mad at you, rocky.

Wait! Ava shouts, I'll take you two!

--- SCENE: MATH CLASS
Here I will replace with something else. I want Rocky to have a moment with Qautre before the recital.
I may skip to the rectial after that.
We'll see
12/15
//Well have a good day you two!
Ava says looking back after stopping the car.
Me and roll unbuckle our seat belts. 
Me and roll just arrived at Jupiter the school
Hey ava could you nulock the
// I like the idea of the Blue Bombers being a sports team at their school
// Maybe the bullies are on the football team
// Now I'm adding all these layers and need to dial back. This isnt a cute sports show.
// What I want to focus on is rockys isolation, rolls lack of reaaction to lonliness, and rockys reletionship to music and Quetre
The car stops; we've arrived at school. Blue Sky Elementary. The school that's been been my personal prison for the last two years.
The car doors slide open and  me and Roll make our way out. Though later than we usually arrive, we still made it to the school early.
From the few students and families that have already arrived I can see the typical finger pointing and side glances. I toss my backpack over my should and do my best 
to ingnore he.
"Oh, wow robots..."
Yes, we're robots!
And Ive been a robot everyday for the past two years I've attended this school!
Is it really so shocking? You'd think the novelty would have worn off at this point. No idea what they even say to themsevles now.
Roll of course remains blissfully unaware of it all. And the moment she hops out of the care waves to every person staring at us, as if they were her best friend.

Amongst the caloous stares and converstaions there stands out our principal paxton and his wife one of our teachers. 
 From the school pricipal and his wife that just shot us a glance I imagine what they say to eachother.
It's a boy... and a girl... but there made of metal!
As in not non-metal?
And there students here!
You mean.. they take classes with the other students?!
Indeed they do... Did I mention that they're ROBOTS.

I shoot the principla a glance back and wave as I chuckle and shake my head. The stupidity of it all is almost funny.
Ava starts to pull off the curb when I call out wait! Ava! The commun almost cause me to forget that I left my guitar in the trunk.
Of all days, forgetting that would be the very worst.

The trunk door flies open and I grab my guitar case when another car pulls up close behind us.
A familiar voice calls out, Hey, Rocky, Roll, morning!
A tallish, big-boned, boy with oval shaped glasses calls out.
He quickly hops out of his mother's car and aproaches us, already carrying his guitar in its case in his hands.
You ready for today's rectial, Rocky? Quatre asks. He sets his guitar down and pulls his school tie from out of his pocket clipping it on then and there.
Ready?... Quatre, ready doesnnt even describe it.

Rocky Ava still seated patiently in the car calls out. Did you get everything you need?
Yeah, ava thanks.

Quatre quatres mther calls out sticking a lunch bag outside the window.
Quatre runs told the window and takes the lunch from her hand before, giving quatre an imploring look.
Ah, mom. He relunctantly leans his head cloer and his mother kisses him on both cheeks.
Love you, Quatre!
Love you too!
Have a good day at school! 1/16
I as Quetra;s moves pull of the curb I look back towards ava who seems to be busy typing some messgae into her dvice. Putting it down, I see roll wave bye to ava
as she drives away.

So Rocky you were saying-? Is everything ok? You look sad.
I pull my eyes away from ava's car and look back towrds quatra.
Uh, yeah, no I'm fine. Anyway, about the recital. I practiced a lot.
I bet qutre smiles pulling out his tie.
No, body works harder than you, Rocky.
I feel a tug on my shirt.
Ro-cky Roll says. You just gonna stand there all day? Well I'm heading in withour you. Breakfast is gonna close soon.

---
// where do I want to go at this point? Some other classes? to the cafeteria? to math class? I'm worried that the rectal would be too sudden of a jump.
Maybe I can have the math class scene. let me think about it for a second.

---
* SCENE: Breakfast Cafeteria: // This is what actually happens, whether or not I use it in the story or move it around, mix and match certain pieces of it in different places, we will see.

3...
I let the final chord draw out and slowly open my eyes.
Seated at the school breakfast cafeteria, I'm seated with across from Roll and Qautre. I just performed the piece I'd be playing for the rectal.
So what do you think I ask quatre who is currently stuffing his face with the lunch Ava packed for me.
hmmm... It's good. Qutre said between bites. But mmm I dont know... He takes a final bite of the sandwhich before downing a boxed orange huice in gulp. 
Ah, I think you might have gone a little too hard with the solo part. Ms. Hodan only asked us to do the first page.

Too hard? I quip. I dont think you know what this means for me Quatra. I said. This isnt about the play this is about my--2/17
future career as an artist blah blah blah yeah I heard it rocky.
Well then you know how important this is too me.
I do rocky qutrea seeming like he was going to continue his mouth hangs open for a moment  before he closes it.
Anyway, he peers into my lunch box, is that all of it Rocky? Portion sizes seem a little small. Are you guys on a diet or something?
FOr the past year, since I met quatre I've basically gievn him my lunch every school day. 
As a robot, I dont need to eat to get my energy. With our buster core systems in place, me and Roll have a nearly infinite energy supply, 
provided we arent doing anyhing too strenous and get regular sleep.
I used to eat more often but now only when I have too sit down with Ava and ROll for a me, or on the occasion Dr. Light comes over.
It's not that I perticularly dislike eating, I just like doing other things with my time anyway. Eating most food just wighs me down and makes me feel glutonus,
so even if I'm a robot and cant gain weight I still hate the way eating makes me feel. In this way I'm the total opposite of Roll, who takes full advantage of her robotic body in this respect.
If eveyday roll had access to a dessert buffet, I'm sure she'd eatchere for everymeal everyday.
--- 
// do I want to finish this scene?
What about when rocky talks about the updates to his hand.
Anyway rocky, youve been playing that thing since we got here.
// you know now I'm not sure I want to write that part.
// the next scene is the recital. That's what's in my outline. 
// I tried to add an exptra scene previously, but it just became an exploration. It's fine. I'll revisit tomorrow.



I used to force myself to eat when I was at school. Thinking having food in my hands would make people think I was more normal, just like them. But it only served to create a public 
spectical a couple times. 
Wait are you sure he's a robot?
Then how is he eating?
It most be like how you can use a pottato to power a lightbulb.

No, Quatra I said, that's all we have and as far as portion sizes go, I think that a pretty normal amount for a boy our age.
I say to my friend almost immediaelty regretting what I said.
While quatre wasnt particularly thin the day I met him 2/18 I think it's obvious to everyone he's gotten more hefty since we've started hanging out.
I never ate my lunch and would usually throw it awway before leaving back to class. One day a few months a Quatre a new student saw me doing this and approached me.
"Hey... if you arent going to finsih that..."
So I guess you could say that Qutre's imppresive appetite is basically the reason for our "friendship"
If you could really call this a friendship.
--- this is the rest of breakfast conversation.
// I was going to have them discuss somethings before the breakfast but now I want to save that for later.
// I feel like I'll just end the scene once they get to school. Let me check my outline.
// This was really just exploratory writing.
// In my outline the conversation durning a meal is during lunch I want to go with that and skip the recital for now.
// I can have a line once rocky and quatre see eachother at school like "see you at music class!"

---
I was suprised at first last year when Quatre approached me during lunch.
I was siting by myself per usual. 
Though at that point, sitting with me was probabaly not an option. Whether you loved robots or hated them. The fact was that
I was the guy who was bring his student to the luicnhall to play very badly all throuout lunch.
I smile thinking about it. All the growth I've made as a gutarist this past year. I used to be terrible.
Quatre came up and asked to sit with me. He asked if I liked video games and to which of course I said yeah (who doesnt?) 
He then pulled out the old school hand held he's currently playing. I was honestly surpriesed it still works.
He then showed me what he was playing. SOme old-school beat 'em up called Viewtiful Joe. He asked me if I wanted to play and 
even handed me a spare handheld. I still have it at home. He's always bugging me to play with him, but the more I've started to take gutar seriously
the less I've brought it to school. Otherwise he'd insist that all we do is play every lunch.

At first, I was very apprehensive toawrds Quatre. I didnt even ask for his name the first two months, yet we sat together everyday for lunch all the same.
I kept waiting for the moment he'd start asking me about robots. Asking me to take him to Light Labs, ask to watch me shoot a laser or transform into a plane or something.
To my suprise, that never happened.
I was shocked when only a couple months ago Quatre told me that he never knew I was a robot. That's when I realized I fundamentally misunderstood Quatre.
Most people say I look human enough but when they get up close, they can tell. Uncanny is the word I keep hearing people say.
SOmething about the texture of my hair. That my skin doesnt have any pores
12/19
Something about me and roll looking a little too perfect. I started to feel so insecure about i. I even asked dr. light to drill holes into my skin so I would have pores
like humans do.
dr. light's response was that he'd consider it for an upgrade but that he was quite busy at the moment. I even went as so far as to think about doing it myself,
untill I realized how pointless it be.
fact was I had two options, try to fool people into thinking I was a robot or just accept the later.
People would find out I was a robot eventually anyway I was sure.

Me and Quatre had sat to gether nearly everday for nearly three months straight. Everyday with him going on endlessly about Monster Hunter or Pheonix Wright or whatever
old handheld game he happened to be playing at the time.

The fact that we talked so often and he hadnt brought it up even once was starting to drive me crazy.
quatre didnt as far as I could tell have a single friend in this whole entire school. and of all the peopleto force his company on he chooses the loathed robot boy?
Further subjecgating himself to a life of isolation.

And still he made no mentaion of my robotics?
Not a single mention?
Just wnhat wes he planning anyway?
To have me help him take over the school? To help him rob the worldslargest video game mueseum?
Huh I mused. He'd gonna be real disapointed if he expects any amzing technilogical feats from me.
Most high-tech thing I've ever done was focus real hard on my visuals and accidentally opened the command-line to my internal interface.
.... I was effectively blind for two days.
Dr. Kaneda hand to come over to shut me off. It was so embarassing.

That was when one day,

Quatre set his game uh ha! The the 15th time in a row! he exclaimed.
Haha, I mused hummuring him, that hard huh? 
You bet! Quatre said.You know, I used to think I was pretty good at Monster Hunter but now... I'm just not sure.
He looked oddly sad when he said this.
I looked at the old gaming device he palaced so gently on top of the the table, even in his frustrated mood, he seemed so gentle when he handled the old device.
Almost as if it was an ancient treasure.
I stopped strumming and set my guitar against my lap, leaning up against it I said, I guess... being good at games is pretty important to you, Quatre.
Quatre lit oh, defintly! And especially Monster Hunter. It's something I take a lot of pride in it, you know? he put his finger to his chin and looked up at the ceiling.
I wonder if I'm having an identity crisis?!
I frowned. Something about the way Qutre felt about the game, it reminded me about how I felt about playing guitar. How would I feel if I statred to question my 
ability to get any better? I didnt even want to imagine it.
//I sympathesized, with Quatre. 
I guess you must really like Monster Hunter, huh.
Quatre shruggered. Yeah, he said quitely, it's my favorite game. He picked up his handheld and took the catririgde out of the device.
But it's a a lot more than that.
Really? I said curioes.
Qautre held up the cartridge and staered at it intently. My dad was one of the lead developers of Monster Hunter XGen. 
Oh, I said that really cool. Is that the only game he worked on? So he doesnt work on the newer games?
quatre held out the cartiridge for me to hold it. I reached out and took the game card in my hand. Not a speck of dust or even the slightest scratch was on it.
The cartiridge was at least 40 years old.
My dad passed away when I was little Quatre said, looking away solemely.
I was at a loss for words. Not quite sure what to say in situations like these. What must losing a father be like. How would I feel if I lost Dr. Light?
The very thought made me feel sick to my stocmach.
That game was the creation of my father, he said pointing to the card. In a way, I guess I almost think of it as a brother, I like to think that
my dad looks down and is happy when he sees me enjoying the game he made.
Quatre... That's Quatre gave me an oddly insecure look as I looked for the words for what I was trying to say.

That's really cool.
He smiled.
Anyway, quatre leaned back in his chair bumping the entire table towards me as he stretched. Enough of the sad stuff... hmmm.
He mused, oh you know what I heard?
What I said, genuinely cursious.
I heard that a robot attends this school as a student! he said with a genuine look of shock.
you just eard that.... 
Oh, he said suprised, so you already knew?!
Yeah, I said, bluntly. Quatre, I already knew, I am the robot.
Quatre looked at me with deep suprise. I can't believe nobody told him.
Has nobody actually bothered to tell him he was sitting with the robot boy these past few months? Just how unpopular
could a kid be?
That's so cool... he said his voice dragging.
I furrowed my brow. He it comes, he's going to start asking me to do a bunch of dumb things 
like ask me to shoot a missle or transform into a jet or something.
ugh, I guess I'll have to find a new table to sit at, or maybe now that he knows he'll get wise and start sitting somewhere else?
Hopefully that happens.
Quatre stretched out his hands and started to pop his fingers. Well, anyway, I'm going to give this level one more try before
lunch is over wish me luck.
Quatre picked the umd from off of the table and turned back on his device. 
I stared at him in disbelief as he quitely focued on the consoles screen as the main menu music started to play.
Hey, I said. 
mm yeah? he replied still staring at his game.
What's your name anyway?
Quatre he said, oh, I never asked yours.
Rocky I replied. My name is ROcky.
And since then we've shared this table every lunch period.
/// 
//Oh, Yeah, Quetre asid. He shrugged with embarrasment. Was I the only person who didnt know? Huh, I guess I was just to busy gaming.
//Have you scene the robot. He asked. I saw some cleaning robots around, but none that looked like they were students.
//Maybe the cleaning bots take classes too? He said, pondering.



Quatre do you even talk to anybody at this 
//
Like a true gamer with just 10 minutes to spare before we need to leave, qutre pulls out a handheld gamming device out of his backpack.
Of in the distance I see Roll seated at a table with most of the girls in her grade all the early risers.
As usaul Rolls seems to be dominating the converstaion. And then can you beleive what Rocky did? I swear he's so annoying! He wont even listen to his older sister.
Hey-did I tell you how I found out I'm Rocky's older sister?!
The girls at Roll's table hang there head as she continues to mouth off.
Rockys so annoying rocky I spit. Roll clearly must not know the definition of the word annoying or she'd realize she's the irratating one...
// lot going on here. Need tminimize.
// What do I need to establish before the guitar class?
I'm honestly suprised Roll's managed to fit herself in with her classmates well enough that theyll sit together for lunch and things.
I'm sure thta Roll's just been unable to read the signs that she wasnt wanted or even if somebody told her, Roll might have actuall lacked the ability to know it was timeto leave

// rocky talks about how roll relates to her classmates and there size
// rocky talks about quatres old school game and what school was like for him initially
// rocky talks about his update and reveals some of his insecurities as a robot     /// I'm just getting these scenes out. 
///         I want this inforamtion. I'll edit and move parts around later
I continue strumming

* SCENE: Recital

The bell rings. Show time.
Music is my last class before lunch break. And I'm totally stoked. I walk to my locker and seeing my guitar case, briefly pause before running my hand along the 
cold black material.
Rocky! ...rocky! 
I can hear the voices chant. the voices of my future fans. 12/18
I make my way to the classrom. Theres a confidet prep to my stride.
I'm the first to arrive and I await eagerly as I 2/20
Eye Ms. Hodan our teacher walk in and start seeting up her conducitn materials.
She gives a slitly vexxed sigh when I beam in her direction. I cant even blame her.
Ms. Hodan I'm sure has her hands full right now, I'd my persistant bugging her probably did do much to lighten that load.
Two weeks from now our school will be holding it's first time playing the play Hamlet. It's going to be the biggest production our school's ever had with both
acting and music. Ms. Hodan will be the one overseeing all things related to that.

Ms. Hodan sets her stand and looks around the room as the bells ring and the students start to slowly pour into the classroom. One by one noting 
Ms. hodan notices a mucis stand missing from one of the front row chairs of the room she reaches in the classroms closet and starts making her way to place

the stand by the chair I speak up. Oh, would you like help with that? I look around the room? Are any other stands missing would you like me to look around and check?
I turn my head from side to side taking note of the room. Seeing on chair bhind me lacking it's accompanying stand. 
I place my gutira upon my chair as I stand to move my stand in front of the desolate chair.
Rock, Ms Hodan started, dont place your stand. You'll need for-
I place the stand down poitning to my head. All up here I say, smiling.
Ms. Hodan raises her eyebrows, vexed and returns to her desk. I look around the  room as the remaining students rool in for the start of class.
Per usual, the students seem to pay me little mind as they settlie in. Almost acting towards me as if I was invisible as they walk by.
They have no idea what is to come!

The play features a segment,where the gutarists in the front row will each play a small solo piece during the interlude. of the four parts, I the first player is given the longest piece.
Initially, when I tried to play  my hands cramped quickly. the settings in my system I just didnt have the strength. I mentioned the situation one day to Dr. Light, he was 
he actually seemed really intrested to hear I was taking up guitar. He even cancelled a TV interview he was scheduled for just so he could update me so I could play longer.
I'd never seen Dr. Light so intrested in something I told him. It really meant a lot to me. I know that playing this part is my opprtunity to make the doctor proud
and my opprotunity to shows my skills to the world.
// rocky paly the second to the last piece.
After Ms. Hodan gives her usual lecture and pep talk to the students it finally time for the retital practice. This will actually be our last practice in class before the play.
As I expected most of the students who play in a group were still fumbling their way through the piece. Off tempo not meorized, with several of them fat fingering every other chord.
I know for a fact we'll sound terribel come the day of they play--as a group, but i wont let it get to me. I mean it is a middle school play, what could you expect?
this is about me.
me, Rocky, showing off to the world my skill. to the world, and to doctor light. Proving for the first time what the great genius is ccapable of. Not to mention what I'm capable of.
// I'm really starting to think I should open the book on the rectal scene.
I see that Ryan still isnt here. But it's not a problem. I know his piece. When it comes time to play his I'll just play his as well.
The next student finishes her piece barely making her way through. Having to play the last page three times before ms. hodan made the call and said it was good enough to today.
Just try to get some practice in before the paly our teacher said.
Ryan's chair remains empty as it comes time for his piece I rasie my hand to offer to play his along with mine when the door opens.
Ryna, mis hodan said. I thought you were goig to be absent to day is everntyhing alir=ight? she asked.
Yea, ryan said I got stuck at the principals he retorted.
Well, it's time to play your piece, ms. hodan said, go ahead and take a seat.
ryan lazily amkes his way to his chair acttually dropping his guitar on the floor in its case before taking of his backpack and taking a seat.
With perhaps the most nonchallant expression I have ever seen he then opens the case and pulls his guitar to his lay before fat fingering the firts chord. 
A horrible concophany buzzes throughout the room.
Thats terribly out of tune ms hodan said and ryan begins to try to tune his guitar by turning the keys at seemingly rsndom.
Ms. Hodan urgers Ryan to switch gutars with another student to which he accepts.

flipping his music sheets to the first page ryan proceeds to fat finger, over strum, and over draw out every single note of the song, being sure to take 
pauses inbewteen each turn of the page that feel like an eternity.

Somewhere in the universe and entire universe just collapesed with in that timeframe. I thought to myself.

Ryan strums the last chord lettingit draw out till the noise fades.
I gegin to shake my head subtellly when I here an entire applause
/// rockys piece needs to come before ryans
my turn I place my fingers to the frets.
I then proceed the play every single solo part, from the very first all the way to mine.
Each note played with careeful procession. Each chord palyed as precisely as I can imagine any boy around my 'age' could play.
As I play I tune out the world completely. My attention is devoted to each note which I have so pain staking memorized. All my weeks of effort. of playig and practicing every single day.
Of taking my guitar to lunch of waking up early to play of playing my piece right before bed have led up to this moment. as I place my hand against the strings to cut out the final chord I open my eyes
and exhale.
flawless. I just played the whole piece to mine flawlessly. I've come so far from where I came from.
Those weeks of playing with sore hands because my fingers couldnt build calusos like other 'biys' but preserving anyway...
 I practiced to I knw I could play the piece flawlessly. and without fail I 
just played the piece flalessly to my entire class and music teacher ms. hodan. 
and soon... I'll pay for the world...
I place my fingers against the strings and give a confident smile. I look straight at my teacher Ms. Hodan. Ready to recive the praise I know she'll have for me.
silence. there's dead silence in the room.
Ryan your piece. Ms. hodan says. And ryan begins to 'play'
did they even hear me. I say queitly to myself. I played flawlessly.

flipping his music sheets to the first page ryan proceeds to fat finger, over strum, and over draw out every single note of the song, being sure to take 
pauses inbewteen each turn of the page that feel like an eternity.
Ryan strums the last chord lettingit draw out till the noise fades.

There was an instant applause.
Bravo bravo, Ms hodan claps.

// CHANGE steven to ryan
wonderful work steven. Ms hodan said. Best performance this sememester.

steven gave a confident smile.

It was nothing.
 he said.
 I actually agreed.
 The other students gave a energetic response.

 that was a amzing steven 
 that was perfect steven
 youre the best steven, a boy said befre learnong towards steven to give him a high-five.

 perfect? Best performance. Is there somehing wrong with my hearing system?
I rubbed my ears for a moment feeling nervous. Perhaps I was in need for some repairs? I couldnt tell what was going on.
How d you play so well another student asked him
Practice. just hard work. Steven bluntly stated, a cocky smile on his face.
I hope he didnt practice too much.

After tthe excitement died down ms. hodan continued.
Let stevens example be a lesson for you class. If you want to really shine in orchestra, alll you have to do do is put in the work.
you dont have too have been doing this long or be be a robot to succeed. Suceeding in music takes practice dedcation!

There was a series of slight snickers that echoed throughout the room. and despite still looking down, I caught at least a couple sideways 
glances in my direction.

I felt my stomach drop. so, that what this is about, isnt it?

Ms. Hodan gives a final pep talk for the play before the bell rings and the students quickly leave the room to head to lucnh.

So it doesnt matter how well I play. I said.
Thinking of the long hours I spent in practice.
Because I'm a...

END SCENE

-- SCENE: LUNCH, BULLIES, AND ROCKY LEARNS ABOUT REI

// Rocky talks to qutre about what happened.
// Rocky question his dream
// "if I have nobody else I know at least doctor light is proud of me"
// hey rocky do you know what happened before you lost your memory?
// this scene will also be exploratory
// I want to tie it to rei, rocky's friend who he forgot.
2/21
// is quatre in band with rocky? originally he was but if he was then i cant have the conversation I was thinking about having.
// if quatre was in the room, there wouldnt be dead silence. 
// Maybe quatre could be in the play in some other capaxity? 
// FOr now quatre isnt in band.
Me and Quatre sat in silence during lunch break. I hung my head low as I thought baout everything that happned.
rocky! Rocky! I could see my fans disapearing one by one as roar of cheers started to die down 
looks like my album didnt sell.
why I thought to myself. still in shock from it all.
i know i played right i know i did better than ryan or anybody in that close.

Then my teachers words rung through my head.
"Let that be a lesson to you"
"you dont have to be a robot to succeed."
// rocky becomes defensive about his "roboitc advantages"
they know... I played well they all did.
it's because I'm a robot! it's becuase I'm a robot they dont care!!
they were frustrated I did well! envious! they assume everything easier, that my efforts dont matter...
just cuase I'm a robot...
I absentmindedly strum my guitaras I ruminate. Not even sure what I'm playing I look down and listen to
My solo piece that I so intricately memorized, I stop and catch mmy hands. I pain full grin croosses my face.
Hey, Rocky Quatre says, the straw from his juice box still plunged to the side of his mouth. he takes a final sip. You really
shouldnt paly too much, remember what happened last time with your hands crammping, he gives a light smile as he crushes his juice 
box, recitels over anyway.
Its okay.. I say still looking down. I bring my left palm to my face. Dr. Light upgraded me. I'm stringer now.
Now my hands dont cramp anymore. 
Quatre who was leeaning back to toss his empty juice box into the near by dumpster freezes and shoots me a suprsied look.
Rocky he says.
What?
I dont know... he stpos tp think. isnt that like cheating.
Cheating! I raise my vocie almost yelling but whating to scream.
cheating I say again threough gritted techt
Hows that cheating? I couldnt play before.
I hold out my hands towards Quatre who looks increasingly nervous.
Without upgrades my hands always stay the same. 
Humans like you you can play guitar and start to build calouses you play more and your muscles get stronger. That's cheating!
Nobody could cheat if there body's always styaed the same like us robots. I point towards Quatre. you Humans are the ones  
who are cheating.
My sudden outburst takes Quatre by suprse. He looks dumbfounded. Almost as if he had no idea I evr felt this way.
Quatre stammers. and places his hand held on the table. Rocky he frowns I never knew you felt this way..
well it just goes to show you dont now me, I retort.
Quatre looks increasingly uncomfortable. He looks from side to side I can only imagine people are staring.
My eyes stay fixed on Quatre.
Let them stare I think. the do anyway. People do anyway. S]from the momet I walk into school to the moment I leave. 
Saying whatever they say about me. The robot.
Quatre leans back in his chair, I expect him to grab hs bag and leave but he stops, his eyes soften as he looks towrd me.
I-I
m sorry, man. I really didnt mean anything by it. I was just looking out for you were friends. He says.
//When did I ever say were friends Quatre 
We not friends, Quatre. I say blunltly.
quatre shakes and his brows furrow. Fine! he shouts back. Then I'll just find somewhere else to sit! he grabs his precious 
handheld. and tosses his bag over his side. Im leaving he says before walking away.
I saty seated and watch Quatre as he lazily walks aways with his typical ungraceful stride.
students at nearby tables fixate on me and whisoer among themselves till the bell rings sounding the beging of the next period.
--
// What happens next?
// rocky refelcts on what he did.
// Quatre was his only friend
// he begins to wonder why it is he has no friends
// he wonders about his status as a robot and reflects on what might have happened before he lost his memory.
// after school he meets bonne who tells rocky about rei.
// in the next scene we'll learn more about who rei is to rocky.
// but will that mean that I'll have to postpone the scene where rocky learns about rolls conference?
// what happens in the original story?
    * SCENE: LUNCH, BULLIES, AND ROCKY LEARNS ABOUT REI
    SCENE: ROCKY TAKES RUSH FOR A “WALK”
    SCENE: ROLL’S FIRST NIGHTMARE
    SCENE: ROCKY GOES TO SEE REI
    SCENE: ROLL’S DEBUT
so I changed the first scene.
Rocky will here about Rei and then we'll learn more about her when in the chapter that rocky goes to see rei which will be the next
rei which will be the day of the conference.
so whats the next flow of events?

* Rocky reflects: the recital, qautre, his relationship to people he learns about rei
* then rocky heads home and is reminded about the conference
* Rocky walks rush and does more reflecting he realizes he's proud to be Light's robot
* Roll's nightmare maybe combinded this with above scene
* the next day we see rei
* then it's rolls chapter // rei lies about the date so rocky wouldnt worry during the conference.
after this the next scene is:     SCENE: PARTY AFTER CONFERENCE, A WORKER WAS KILLED
The story is changing a bit. But I'm okay with this. Did I add a scene? I did. But it's fine. Too many and I'll rethink the scedule
