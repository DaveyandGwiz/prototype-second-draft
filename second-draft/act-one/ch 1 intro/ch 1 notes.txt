- Scene: Before Rectial

I know I want a scene where Rocky reflects on what happened at the rectal.
I think what I'll do is follow the outline I have.
The first class is Rocky's rectial where he plays his solo piece for the play, Hamlet.
Rocky will discuss his feelings afterward during lunch. Him and quatre will talk but I'm not sure if they'll get into a fight yet.
I know during lunch Rocky will reflect on how people treat him and he will also learn about Rei's condition.
