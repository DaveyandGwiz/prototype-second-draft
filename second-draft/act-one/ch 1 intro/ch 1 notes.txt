- Scene: Before Rectial

I know I want a scene where Rocky reflects on what happened at the rectal.
I think what I'll do is follow the outline I have.
The first class is Rocky's rectial where he plays his solo piece for the play, Hamlet.
Rocky will discuss his feelings afterward during lunch. Him and quatre will talk but I'm not sure if they'll get into a fight yet.
I know during lunch Rocky will reflect on how people treat him and he will also learn about Rei's condition.




- Scene: Recital

Rocky is only of the players giving a solo piece during the play Hamlet.
rocky has prepared a great deal.
Rocky plays well but is ignored.
At lunch he argues with Quatre
He learns about Rei
Aftwards, he reflects but he will reflect more when he learns about Rei
// So far I'm unhappy with the fact that Rocky's memory loss hasnt been brought up.
// Perhaps it wont be broguht up untill we learn about Rei.
// This will also make us start to question the goodness of Dr. Light, whom Rocky sees as all good.
// Perhaps eve, all that is good
